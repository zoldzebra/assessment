# JavaScript/Front-end Developer - Exercise 1

## Instructions

- Fork this project.
- Write tests.
- Don't use external libraries for the conversion.
- Commit the important milestones and not just the final result.

## Exercise description

Create an application that contains a web form, which has a numeric input field and a submit button.

When the user gives an arabic number, the system shows the english phrase of that number.

For example:
<pre>
7    == seven
42   == forty-two
2001 == two thousand and one
1999 == nineteen hundred and ninety-nine
17999 == seventeen thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine
</pre>

That's all.
